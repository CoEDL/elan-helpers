Tools and scripts for working with ELAN


## Split Audio By Annotation
The script reads the Elan files and slice audio based on annotations on the first tier. You can choose other tiers by passing a tier name, or a different order number as an argument to the script. Note that the tier name or number has to be consistent across the data set.
