# elan-helpers
Tools and scripts for working with ELAN. See the README file in each script folder for usage instuctions.

## Elan to JSON
The script reads an Elan file (or a directory including Elan files) and exports a JSON file with the annotations on a selected tier. You can choose which tier by passing a tier name, tier type, or a tier order number as an argument to the script. Note that the tier selection has to be consistent across the data set.
